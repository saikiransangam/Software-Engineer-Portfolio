It extends the idea of self-training and distillation with the use of equal-or-larger student models and noise added to the student during learning. Noisy student training achieves 88.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, which is 2.0% better than the state-of-the-art model that requires labeled instagram images. This approach not only surpasses the top1 ImageNet accuracy of SOTA models by 1%, its robustness of a model also improves.",
